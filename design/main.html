The purpose of Class A1 is to provide a fair amount of compute and network power inside a small frame. A1 Class servers will be used to host mission critical services, such as DNS or Kubernetes Master nodes.</p><p>A1 Servers are designed to have a high uptime, so the CPU model is kept to a relatively low spec to allow for overkill cooling, and low power draw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Network Design</h1><h1>Physical Machines</h1><h2>Hydrogen (Class A1)</h2><p>Hydrogen is the 'master node' of the estate.
